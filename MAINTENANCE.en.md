Dear users!

There were technical problems on the service provider's side, which could cause problems with processing files in Teamlogs. We apologize for the inconvenience.
<br><br>

If your file is in the "processing" status, it means that it is already in the queue for processing and will be ready in the near future. <br><br>

Thank you for your patience and understanding
